    <h2>What is skating?</h2>
    <section class="skating">

            <p>Skating is a recreation sport simular to cycling or rollerskating however with the goal being slightly different. In skating without any handle bars you have to 
            focus and control your board with your feet. As you progress in skating you will learn how to do trick which are different ways to manipulate the directions of your 
            board. Ramps are also a big part of skating. Learning to keep your balance and do tricks while moving in strange directions.
